1870's keyboard mindset had it best.

<!-- ![Christopher Sholes](/articles/wield-the-keyboard/Christopher-Sholes.webp 'Christopher Sholes') -->

For context, in 1868, the typewriter was invented by a man named [Christopher Sholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Latham_Sholes). It featured a long role of paper and a keyboard literally resembling a piano. It had black keys and white keys, laid out in two rows. It did not contain keys for the numerals 0 or 1 because the letters O and I were deemed sufficient.

```
 3 5 7 9 N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
2 4 6 8 . A B C D E F G H I J K L M

```

Five years later, the same man put together a layout for his typewriter keys that simply made the keys jam less. How convenient...

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - =
Q W E R T Y U I O P [ ] \
A S D F G H J K L ; '
Z X C V B N M , . /

```

Keeping Shole's same mindset of reducing friction and improving productivity, lets apply this to our work today. Many of us rely on a series of buttons that we bang our fingers against to create lines of text. The more we [practice](https://monkeytype.com/), the faster and more accurate we get. That alone is incredubly useful, but what else can we use the keyboard for?

### Shortcuts

Go into the settings of many modern apps and you'll likely find a section on keyboard shortcuts. These give you the ability to make your way around the app without having to use your mouse. I'm not going to argue that a mouse is bad because it's just a different tool, but I will argue that the keyboard is far more versitile than the mouse when handled effeciently.

If there are shortcuts for the apps you use, it just makes sense to use them. Learning them all at once isn't usually the way to go. Instead just take a few at a time, get good at using those, and then go back and learn a few more. This is why accessability in software development is so important, but that's an article for another time. Apps with great accessability will allow you to navigate around the whole app and all of its functionality with your keyboard and it makes Sholes most proud.

Overall, getting comfortable with the keyboard and seeing it as a wieldy tool makes for a quick and generally enjoyable user experience.

Some shortcuts that I find particularly useful in my work of writing software are:
